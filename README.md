# Script Master's PhoneGap App

Evaluate js stuff in phone using this simple app.

A basic app, with the bare-minimum files required to create a phone gap app, play with the js features in your mobile (kinda like a js console).

## 2 important files: 1) config.xml and  2) index.html

## Reference files:
	css/index.css
	js/index.js

## Icon files
	res/icon/*     ==> for app icons
	res/screen/*   ==> for splash screen.


## Thats pretty much !
