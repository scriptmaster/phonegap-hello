# Script Master's PhoneGap App

Evaluate js stuff in phone using this simple app.

A basic app, with the bare-minimum files required to create a phone gap app, and to explore various js api in your mobile (kinda like a js console).

## 2 important files:

###1) www/config.xml
###2) www/index.html



## Reference files:
	www/css/index.css
	www/js/index.js

## Icon files
	www/res/icon/*     ==> for app icons
	www/res/screen/*   ==> for splash screen.


## Thats pretty much !
